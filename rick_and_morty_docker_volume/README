This application stores api data in a database every minute.

To use this application : 
    1. clone the repository
    2. cd PATH/rick_and_morty/rick_and_morty_docker_volume
    3. mkdir data
    4. docker-compose up -d

    Warning: I have created a volume in the docker-compose and linked it to the different services. A folder is indeed created on the local disk (named dbdata), but I don't understand how to copy the data from the docker to the local disk.
